## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding project.

This is a simple tip calculator built with vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS, aimed at practcing my own javascript skills.
Simply enter the total bill and tip percent and the calculator will calculate your bill for you.

### Have fun playing around with it!
